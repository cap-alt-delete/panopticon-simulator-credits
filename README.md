<h1>Panopticon Simulator (spring 2021)</h1>
<p>This video project was done to analyze the essentials of an assemblage (specifically Foucault's Panopticon) through the language of code. Given code's lack of ambiguity, along with the time-intensive nature of coding, it brought an important constraint to the project: indentifying and focusing on the actants that were essential to making the simulator identifiable as the Panopticon.

<h2>Audio Credits</h2>
<p> All coding and screen recording was done by me, but the audio used was sourced from Youtube's Audio Library. In the order played in the video, the audio files are:</p>
<p>Keyboard Typing Fast (Office category)</p>
<p>Simple by Patrick Patrikios (Free music under YouTube Audio Library License)</p>

<p>Radio Static (Foley category)</p>
